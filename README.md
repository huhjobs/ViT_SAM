# Loss Geometry of Vision Transformers on Small Dataset Training

- Investigated Vision Transformers through the lens of loss geometry.
- Demonstrated that Multihead Self-Attention reduces the non-linearity of loss landscape and Sharpness-Aware Minimization algorithm smooths the loss landscape

* ops, pyhessian, sampytorch are the modified versions of the modules in https://github.com/davda54/sam.
